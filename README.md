# MLP from Scratch for MNIST Digit Classification

## Overview

This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using only Python and NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, forward propagation, loss calculation, backward propagation, and model evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com:tom-bou/MLP-from-scratch.git
    cd MLP-from-scratch
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

3. Install the dataset

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used for training and evaluating the model. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).
